# Purpose

Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock) allows programmers to create advanced Internet, intranet and other network-compatible applications to transmit application data over the wire, regardless of the network protocol being used. With winsock, programmers have access to advanced Microsoft® Windows® networking features such as multicast and Quality of Service (QoS).

# Developer audience

Windows Sockets 2 is designed for use by C / C ++ programmers. Familiarity with the Windows network is required.

# Runtime requirements

Windows Sockets 2 can be used on all Windows platforms. When certain implementations or features of the Windows Sockets 2 platform restrictions exist, they are clearly noted in the documentation.
